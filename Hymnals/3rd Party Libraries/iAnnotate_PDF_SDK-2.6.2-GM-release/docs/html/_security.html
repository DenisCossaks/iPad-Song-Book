<div class="textblock"><p>The iAnnotate PDF SDK has been implemented using best security practices, and provides support for security-conscious applications including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Full support of iOS Data Protection (see <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4175">http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4175</a>). This includes using the NSFileProtectionComplete attribute on all persistent and temporary files created by the SDK. Please note that incoming PDF files are *not* modified: so if your application wishes to take advantage of iOS Data Protection, it must set the appropriate file attributes for PDF files and any other files used outside of the scope of the iAnnotate PDF SDK. </li>
<li>
The iAnnotate PDF SDK includes full support for encrypted PDFs. Encrypted PDFs cannot be accessed without the appropriate password, and all permissions requested by the PDF author are respected by the iAnnotate PDF SDK. (So, for example, it is not possible to add annotations to an encrypted PDF file that is protected against adding annotations, using this SDK.) When annotations are added to an encrypted PDF, they are also encrypted with the same level of security as the original. </li>
<li>
PDF passwords are never persisted by the SDK. (If passwords should be saved for the user, the client application should use the iOS Keychain to accomplish this.) </li>
<li>
For high-security environments, you can provide the PDF data in an NSData object (see <a class="el" href="interface_a_p_p_d_f_document.html#a9d91a3b0fb953e04c2c2b7c2b7779ad0">initWithPDFData: (APPDFDocument)</a>), in which case the SDK will never write any of the PDF information to disk, whether or not annotations are added to the PDF. </li>
<li>
The iAnnotate PDF SDK does not initiate any kind of network connection, so will never transmit any data off of the device. Likewise, it will never use iOS inter-app communication functionality to launch another app or otherwise transmit data to any other app or service on the device. If requested (through user interaction), it may place textual data on the pasteboard, and receive data from the pasteboard using standard text-based UI controls (for example, when selecting text or editing a note). </li>
</ul>
<p>Some notes about potential points of exposure for security-conscious environments: </p>
<ul>
<li>
If relying on the iOS Data Protection APIs to secure user data, please be sure to research and familiarize yourself with the requirements and limitiations of this technique, in particular what is required of the end user's configuration in order to support encryption. </li>
<li>
The limitations of the iOS Data Protection APIs means that the SDK is forced to have some potential exposure points: <ul>
<li>
The <a class="el" href="interface_a_p_p_d_f_information.html">APPDFInformation</a> files used by the SDK are sqlite (<a href="http://www.sqlite.org">http://www.sqlite.org</a>) database files. When working with the files, temporary journal files can be used by the SDK. Due to the ephemeral nature of these files, it is not possible for the SDK to apply the protected file attributes when they are created. Therefore, it is potentially possible (though highly unlikely) that an application crash (force-quit) could be triggered by an attacker during a processing operation, which could potentially leave an unencrypted journal file on disk, which could potentially have PDF textual content or annotation content stored within it. </li>
<li>
Though no other specific instances are known at this time, it's possible that other system libraries (or iOS itself) that are used by the iAnnotate PDF SDK could make similar use of temp files. However, all temporary files explicitly managed by the SDK are properly protected (or not used when using the in-memory APIs). </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
In order to perform the required functionaltiy, the PDF SDK does keep textual PDF contents, the contents of PDF annotations, and PDF passwords unencrypted in device memory (RAM) at certain times. </li>
<li>
Due to the nature of iOS, it is not possible to prevent the user from taking a screen shot of a running application with PDF contents displayed in an <a class="el" href="interface_a_p_p_d_f_view_controller.html">APPDFViewController</a>. </li>
</ul>
